  Recursive factorial of a number
  Problem - Give an integer 'n', find the factorial of that integer
  
  * The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n', denoted n!, is the product of all positive integers less
  * than or equal to 'n'.

  its solution was:
    let results = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {results *= i}
    return results;
  * look at 8th module
