/*
  Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller
  instances of the same problem

  More Technically:
  Recursion is when a function calls itself

  It's
  A great technique to simplify your solution
  If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem,
  recursion is very useful

  He gave an example of a university
  that has 2 professors
  under them are 4 teachers
  each teacher has his own students
  ! Teachers are A, B C, and D sets
  ? professors teach 2 sets: Science & E-commerce
  if we ask: what's the total number of science students
  ? it's the equivalent of students under [👨‍🏫A] & [👨‍🏫B]
  Go to the Video, Imma not Explain more😡

  A few points about recursion
  ? Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
  ! if not: infinite loop will crash your program

  Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution.
  A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.

  Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. Do not give up if you
  struggle with the concept.
