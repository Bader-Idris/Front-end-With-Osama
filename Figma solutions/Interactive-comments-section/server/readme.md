# Good advices, tips and tricks for creating a robust article web app

- this is how to differentiate admin & user, when creating a DB

```js
// Middleware to check if user is authenticated and has admin role
const isAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated() && req.user.role === 'admin') {
    return next();
  }
  res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
};

// Route for creating a database (accessible only to admins)
app.post('/create-database', isAdmin, (req, res) => {
  // Create the database logic here
});
```

- Handle Database Creation: Within the protected route, you can execute the necessary database creation logic using a PostgreSQL library like `pg-promise` or `node-postgres`.

```javascript
const db = require('your-pg-library');

app.post('/create-database', isAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Check if the authenticated user is an admin
    // Perform necessary database creation logic using the db library
    res.status(200).send('Database created successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error creating database');
  }
});
```

- it's a good topic setting those differentiated authentication and authorization issues.

### how to use Near Field Communication (NFC) for payments inside of our app?

Bito response:

```txt
To implement NFC-based money transactions using programming, you typically need to consider the following steps:
1. Device Setup: Ensure that both the payment terminal and the mobile device support NFC functionality and have it enabled.
2. Payment App Development: Create a mobile application that enables users to initiate and complete payment transactions. This app should have the necessary security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to ensure secure transactions.
3. Data Exchange: Use NFC protocols to establish a connection between the mobile device and the payment terminal. This involves exchanging data, such as transaction details and payment credentials, securely between the two devices.
4. Transaction Processing: Once the connection is established, the payment terminal processes the transaction by verifying the payment credentials and deducting the appropriate amount from the user's account. This step may involve integration with payment gateways or financial institutions.
5. Confirmation and Feedback: Provide confirmation to the user about the successful completion of the transaction. This can include displaying transaction details, sending receipts, or updating account balances.
It's important to note that implementing NFC-based money transactions requires adherence to security standards and compliance with payment industry regulations. Therefore, it is advisable to consult relevant documentation, guidelines, and APIs provided by payment service providers or financial institutions to ensure compliance and security.
Additionally, programming languages and frameworks such as Java, Kotlin, Swift, or frameworks like React Native, Xamarin, or Flutter can be used to develop the mobile application for NFC-based money transactions.
Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the platform, payment provider, and programming language you choose. It is recommended to refer to the documentation and resources provided by your chosen platform or payment service provider for more detailed guidance.

### message queues in programming

```txt
Now, let's see an example of using Express with JavaScript as a full-stack production project with a message queue.

1. Setting up the Message Queue:
   - Choose a message queue system, such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or AWS SQS.
   - Install the necessary libraries or SDKs for your chosen message queue system.
2. Producer Side (Express Backend):
   - Set up an Express server to handle incoming requests.
   - When a request is received, process the necessary data and create a message.
   - Use the message queue library or SDK to publish the message to the queue.
3. Consumer Side (Express Backend or Separate Service):
   - Set up a consumer that listens to the message queue for incoming messages.
   - When a message is received, process it accordingly.
   - The consumer can be a separate service or part of the same Express backend.
Real-world examples of using message queues with Express and JavaScript can include:
1. Order Processing System:
   - When a customer places an order, the order details are sent to a message queue.
   - A separate service or backend listens to the queue and processes the order asynchronously.
   - This allows the order processing to happen independently, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
2. Email Notification System:
   - When a user signs up or performs a specific action, an email notification is triggered.
   - The notification details are sent to a message queue.
   - A separate service or backend listens to the queue and sends the email notifications asynchronously.
   - This decouples the email sending process from the main application, improving performance and reliability.
