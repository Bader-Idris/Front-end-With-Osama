## How to run Ts in your machine?

- `nodejs` is required
- then install its package by: `npm i typescript`, if globally add `-g` as `npm i -g blab`
- then check if it's installed in the project as: `tsc -v`

[Check its website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- You can check installing it in the project [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

- **ðŸ”´ Compile Ts Files ðŸ”´**
- to compile 'em use: `tsc fileName.ts`
- `tsc -h` to get help information
- `tsc -w` is to watch migrating ts to js files, which is awesome, even if you delete the `dist` folder where you put every compiled js from TS, it'll re-create it when enabling watch mode
- ðŸ”´ we can remove comments in js migrated files
