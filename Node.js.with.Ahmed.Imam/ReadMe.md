##**Node.js is a server-side platform**
built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine)
## it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
###[so it's working on V8 Engine] as a compiler

there are three types of languages collaborating with machines
### single threaded language
### multi-threaded language
### non-blocking threaded language ✅
**our node.js uses the last type, he said it's the best of 'em**
non-blocking thread is distinguished from single with this:
it gives requests to server and doesn't wait for its response, but single-thread waits for every request to complete.
multi-thread uses huge memory, so the server might hang

## **what will we learn?**
#### V8 Engine
#### JavaScript Intro
#### Express[framework]
#### Routing
#### Modules
#### REST API
#### MEAN stack[MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node]
we need to learn angular framework before [MEAN stack]
