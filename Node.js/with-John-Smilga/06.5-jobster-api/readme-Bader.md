# Full Project collecting all of what we learned

in this project we'll finally combine auth knowledge with CRUD functionality

- as a result: we'll have an API, when users login, and manage their job search
- we'll also learn how to deploy it to Heroku, hosting our app to cloud
- set up nice documentation
- Front-end isn't cared about here, it's only for decorating our API APP `Back-end`
- Its View is built-in React
- Dealing with URL is important to make project works
- saving passwords as bare string is horribly bad practice, in hour7 it was that simple, later John's gonna make it as JWT string
- check collections when creating mongodb user and jobs, in its website, and make sure you're connecting thy IP
- for passwords using JWT we'll use hash algorithm
- John uses `bcryptjs` package
- in front-end we can encode data before it's sent, reminds me of what Osama said before, in his jQuery projects
- John stops user from repeating his/her email address, but not the userName

---

- `mongoDB instance method` is another solution for `register functionality` check its route [here=>](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods)
