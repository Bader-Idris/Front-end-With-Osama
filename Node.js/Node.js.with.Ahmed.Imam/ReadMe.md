##**Node.js is a server-side platform**
built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine)
## it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
###[so it's working on V8 Engine] as a compiler

there are three types of languages collaborating with machines
### single threaded language
### multi-threaded language
### non-blocking threaded language ✅
**our node.js uses the last type, he said it's the best of 'em**
non-blocking thread is distinguished from single with this:
it gives requests to server and doesn't wait for its response, but single-thread waits for every request to complete.
multi-thread uses huge memory, so the server might hang

## **what will we learn?**
#### V8 Engine
#### JavaScript Intro
#### Express[framework]
#### Routing
#### Modules
#### REST API
#### MEAN stack[MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node]
we need to learn angular framework before [MEAN stack]

<!-- until 6th lesson he explained basics of 🍦JS [skipped]-->
###### Download node.js from http://nodejs.org 
after we go to our node.js directory as:
E:\coding_and_programming\HTML_and_CSS_Elzero\Node.js.with.Ahmed.Imam
**we type** npm init before accessing node, meaning [npm initialize]
###### then it asks for dir's name as (first_app)
In my cmd it didn't ask me. So I typed the nae of my Dir
**then** it announce our version (1.0.0)
**then** description
**then** entry point (dir name)
**then** test command **for tended type of host**
**then** git repository **asking for our git account**
**then** keyboard[didn't mention for what]
**then** author[Lover of Handay, does she deserve?!]
**then** license [ISC] we pass it, not having any license
file extension will be [json]
**then** we open [code .] VSC, it'll open our tended file
<!-- so, if I go to a dir, then open vsc by [code .] it'll be as a work -->
**then** we create a js file and open its terminal instead of that junk cmd🙂
**then** to run code we type in terminal the following:
node app[node then our file name without its extension]
